# assets folder

- Place assets such as html on the html subfolder, images/vidoes on the media subfolder, and css on the styles subfolder.

## General Instructions:

- For styling, don't change global.css if possible, prefer using style tags inside components (see componets folder's AGENTS.md for more info on styling components)
