# assets folder

- Place assets such as html on the html subfolder, images/vidoes on the media subfolder, and css on the styles subfolder.

## General Instructions:

- For styling, don't change src/assets/styles/global.css if possible, prefer using style tags inside components (see componets folder's AGENTS.md for more info on styling components)
- The src/assets/styles/theme.js file holds variables such as color and media breakpoints.
Edit them as needed.
- For css's font-size prefer using the rem unit.
  For that, consider 1rem equals 1px, so if you were to use 16px, use instead 16rem.
  For things other than font-size do not use rem.
